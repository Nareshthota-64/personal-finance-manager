# personal-finance-manager

The Personal Finance Manager project streamlines financial management with features like account management, expense tracking, interactive charts, and savings targets. This empowers users to take control of their finances with ease and precision. I am deeply thankful to EY GDS and AICTE for the invaluable internship experience, which significantly enhanced my technical skills and provided practical, hands-on learning opportunities in a professional environment.
